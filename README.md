## Applied Data Science Capstone Project

## 1) Introduction/Business Problem

Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the Foursquare location data to solve or execute. Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.

Through my study, I want to be able to help people open up restaurants in popular places around Toronto, Canada. Using this data, people will be able to know what's around them as well as where the optimal place to set up their spot would be in order to attract the most amount of customers and revenue. 

## 2) Downloading and Prepping Data
Describe the data that you will be using to solve the problem or execute your idea. Remember that you will need to use the Foursquare location data to solve the problem or execute your idea. You can absolutely use other datasets in combination with the Foursquare location data. So make sure that you provide adequate explanation and discussion, with examples, of the data that you will be using, even if it is only Foursquare location data.

In order to provide intersted stakeholders with necessary knowledge about my study, I used Toronto neighborhood data from Wikipedia. 

## 3) Methodology
Methodology section which represents the main component of the report where you discuss and describe any exploratory data analysis that you did, any inferential statistical testing that you performed, and what machine learnings were used and why.

In this study, I used the census data to make a choropleth graph to display the most popular neighborhoods in Toronto Canada. I have place markers on this spots so stakeholders can get an accurate and easy understanding of where exactly to put their potantial shops.
