## Applied Data Science Capstone Project

## 1) Introduction/Business Problem

### Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the Foursquare location data to solve or execute. Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.

Through my study, I want to be able to help people open up restaurants in popular places around Toronto, Canada. Using this data, people will be able to know what's around them as well as where the optimal place to set up their spot would be in order to attract the most amount of customers and revenue. 

## 2) Downloading and Prepping Data
Describe the data that you will be using to solve the problem or execute your idea. Remember that you will need to use the Foursquare location data to solve the problem or execute your idea. You can absolutely use other datasets in combination with the Foursquare location data. So make sure that you provide adequate explanation and discussion, with examples, of the data that you will be using, even if it is only Foursquare location data.

In order to provide intersted stakeholders with necessary knowledge about my study, I used Toronto neighborhood data from Wikipedia. 

## 3) Methodology
Methodology section which represents the main component of the report where you discuss and describe any exploratory data analysis that you did, any inferential statistical testing that you performed, and what machine learnings were used and why.

In this study, I used the census data to make a choropleth graph to display the most popular neighborhoods in Toronto Canada. I have place markers on this spots so stakeholders can get an accurate and easy understanding of where exactly to put their potential shops based on the surroundings.

## 4) Results
Results section where you discuss the results.

As shown through the choropleth map, we can conclude that a good spot to open a new shop would be around major roads and intersections. In addition,based on the map, stakeholders should look to open up shop in major, populated districted such as the Financial District, which has a handful of malls, restaurants, etc. This major spot would bring in a lot of customers and revenue for a newly opening business. 

## 5) Discussion
Discussion section where you discuss any observations you noted and any recommendations you can make based on the results.

As said before, I would recommend stakeholders open up shop along major roads/intersections as well as in places where theres already lots of shops. Even though opening up a shop in an already populated shop area seems hard, it can still be done. In additon to the Toronto Data, it might be useful to also get population data from each district in order to see if populour neighborhoods have more shops. 

## 6) Conclusion
Conclusion section where you conclude the report.

This report may be helpful for stakeholders who want to open up say a restaurant, retail store, etc. The data and results will allow stakeholders to clearly see where the best places in Toronto are to open up a shop. However, this report is not conclusive as it does not take into account many other data, such as other cities, crime rates, etc. which can change a stakeholders opinion of where to open up a shop.
